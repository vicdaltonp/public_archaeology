<p>Public Archaeology is the presentation of archaeological research or data to the general public. From books and websites to museum exhibits and heritage sites, Public Archaeology can take a variety of forms. Regardless of the form it takes, Public Arcaheology always involves the exhibition or demonstration of archaeological information in an open, community-focused format.Often, Public Archaeology encompasses two or even all three of these objectives.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the Point?</h3>

<p>Public Archaeology has three main components:
  <ul>
      </ul>

      <li><strong>Preservation</strong>
      <p>Public Archaeology often seeks to raise awareness of certain culturally or historically significant sites in order to raise awareness and encourage preservation.</p><li>
     
      <strong>Education</strong>
      <p>Just as Public Archaeology is often utilized for preservation, education can be an influential concern of Public Archaeology. Whether geared toward preserving something specific or simply contributing to society's knolwedge, education of plays a key role in Public Archaeology.</p>

      <li><strong>Engagement</strong>
      <p>Arguably the most broad of the three objectives, engagement with Public Archaeology can also have the most far-reaching impacts. Preservation and education are important, but by pursuing engagement through Public Archaeology, archaeologists are able to allow to encourage unforseen benefits to arise as the public engages with the history in culture in their own, unique ways.</li>

      <p>The distinctions between these three components often become blurred when exploring Public Archaeology, but it is important to acknolwedge the role each has in both the reasons and outcomes of Public Archaeology.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
