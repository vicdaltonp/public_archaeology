<p>Public Archaeology is the presentation of archaeological research or data to the general public. From books and websites to museum exhibits and heritage sites, Public Archaeology exists in a variety of ways. Regardless of the form it takes, Public Archaeology involves the exhibition or demonstration of archaeological information in an open, public space that is typically geared toward a community of people or society in general.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the point?</h3>

<p>Public Archaeology has three main components:
  <ul>
      </ul>

      <li><strong>Preservation</strong>
      <p>Public Archaeology often seeks to raise awareness of certain culturally or historically significant sites in order to raise awareness and encourage preservation. Preservation is an important part of archaeology, and through Public Archaeology this goal can be presented to a broader audience.</p><li>
     
      <strong>Education</strong>
      <p>Just as Public Archaeology is utilized for preservation, education is also an influential concern when designing and presenting archaeological information to the public. Whether implemented for preservation or simply for the contribution to societyâ€™s knowledge, education is a central dimension of Public Archaeology.</p>

      <li><strong>Engagement</strong>
      <p>While education and preservation are two key aspects of Public Archaeology, it is only through engagement that either of these goals can be accomplished. In addition, by merely seeking to engage the public without any specific goal of education or preservation, the material is able to speak to people and allow them to interact with the ideas presented in their own unique ways.</li>

      <p>The distinctions between these three components often become blurred when exploring Public Archaeology, but it is important to acknowledge the role each has in shaping the design and presentation of the archaeological data.</p>
